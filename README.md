# Customer Behaviour Analysis

### Introduction:
In early 2021, driven by a profound passion for Japanese cuisine, Danny Ma embarked on a journey into entrepreneurship by establishing his own restaurant. Specializing in sushi, curry, and ramen, Danny's Diner aims to provide a cozy dining experience centered around his favorite dishes.

### Problem Statement:
Danny's Diner is facing operational challenges and requires assistance in navigating its trajectory. While basic operational data has been collected during the initial phase, the restaurant lacks the necessary expertise to effectively utilize this information.

Danny aims to leverage the available data to address fundamental inquiries concerning customer behavior, specifically focusing on visitation patterns, spending habits, and menu preferences. By gaining deeper insights into customer preferences, Danny hopes to enhance the dining experience and foster stronger customer loyalty.

### Key Datasets:

3. Members: Records the join dates of customers in the loyalty program.

### Case Study Questions:
The case study presents a series of questions, each of which can be answered using a single SQL statement. These questions encompass various aspects of customer behavior, including spending patterns, visitation frequencies, menu preferences, and engagement with the loyalty program.
