# Customer Behaviour Analysis

### Introduction:
In early 2021, driven by a profound passion for Japanese cuisine, Danny Ma embarked on a journey into entrepreneurship by establishing his own restaurant. Specializing in sushi, curry, and ramen, Danny's Diner aims to provide a cozy dining experience centered around his favorite dishes.

### Problem Statement:
Danny's Diner is facing operational challenges and requires assistance in navigating its trajectory. While basic operational data has been collected during the initial phase, the restaurant lacks the necessary expertise to effectively utilize this information.

Danny aims to leverage the available data to address fundamental inquiries concerning customer behavior, specifically focusing on visitation patterns, spending habits, and menu preferences. By gaining deeper insights into customer preferences, Danny hopes to enhance the dining experience and foster stronger customer loyalty.

### Key Datasets:
Three primary datasets have been provided for this case study:

1. Sales: Contains customer-level purchase data, including order dates and product IDs.
2. Menu: Maps product IDs to corresponding product names and prices.
3. Members: Records the join dates of customers in the loyalty program.

### Case Study Questions:
The case study presents a series of questions, each of which can be answered using a single SQL statement. These questions encompass various aspects of customer behavior, including spending patterns, visitation frequencies, menu preferences, and engagement with the loyalty program.
1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
